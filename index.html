                    <p>I go to Bellevue College and just started learning HTML and CSS, but soon I'm
                        going to explore JavaScript and GitHub. My main focus is to expand my knowledge in coding and
                        contribute to making projects that are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. I haven't
                        thought about it recently, but I may be willing to work on group projects. You can reach me at

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>While attending Bellevue College, I'm planning on earning a Certificate of Accomplishment in Web
                        Content Management. However, after looking through potential careers and learning about coding,
                        I might direct most of my attention to front-end web development. Therefore, I'm
                        planning on looking into frameworks and libraries as well as cross-browser and device testing in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>Before Bellevue College, I graduated from Whittier College with a Bachelor's Degree, majoring in
                        kinesiology and minoring in physics. However, I lost interest in careers associated with those
                        fields of study. That's how I ended up as a warehouse associate.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6" id="experience">
                    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>I have worked as a full-time warehouse associate at Amazon Fresh for almost 8 years at the time
                        of writing this. I actually used what I learned in kinesiology and physics to modify my
                        movements and develop a personal routine to enhance my performance to the best of my physical
                        ability and accomplish team goals. My main responsibility was to pick and pack customer orders
                        efficiently with decent pack quality. Eventually, I learned more about the computer system used
                        to manage orders and communicated with managers, coworkers, and drivers to make sure that
                        customer orders contained all desired items with no damages and were shipped out on time.
                        Unfortunately, I don't have any work experience that involves coding.</p>

                    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                    <p>My ultimate goal is to change careers from manual labor to one that is technical and more related
                        to computers. After getting injured multiple times and slowly burning out, it seemed as though I
                        have already reached my peak at my current job, and I have no interest in moving up.
                        So, now I am looking for a career that falls more along the lines of problem-solving.

        <!--Interests and Favorite Websites-->

                <div class="col-lg-6" id="interests">
                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <p>For as long as I can remember, my greatest weaknesses included communicating and interacting with
                        others. As a result, I went through life preferring to be on my own. One activity that allowed
                        me to remain in my comfort zone and still be entertained was playing video games. However, I'm
                        also not very competitive. I just don't like comparing myself to others or being placed in some
                        kind of ranking system. So, the games that are most successful in grabbing my attention have
                        single player modes as well as good storylines and character customization features.</p>
                    <p>I have also recently become interested in art and learning. Similarly to gaming, drawing and
                        reading give me the freedom to do my own thing without any awkward encounters with people. I
                        get to express myself and enjoy a good story or tutorial.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, my main hobbies include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Casual gaming</li>
                        <li>Drawing</li>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6" id="websites">
                    <h3>Favorite Websites</h3>
                    <p>There are tons of skills to develop, activities to participate in, places to explore, and
                        experiences to enjoy or learn from, and yet, there is just not enough time to do it all. I still
                        haven't figured out what I want to specialize in. I haven't even figured out what I'm truly
                        passionate about. What I do know is that I have a lot of things to research. The field of study
                        I'm going for is not going to be an easy one. So, to make research and learning easier, I found
                        myself making use of the Internet and looking through websites to facilitate in understanding
                        some of the concepts of my classes. My favorite websites include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These websites are also great for finding more resources for my hobbies, such as tutorials and
                        forums. They can even provide sources of entertainment, such as images, videos, and additional
                        websites. Another website that I visit a lot is <a
                            href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/canvas/" target="_blank">Bellevue College Canvas</a>.
                        I use it for my classes. <a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/" target="_blank">Bellevue
                            College</a> has other beneficial resources, features, and
                        information.</p>
