                    <p>I am currently a full-time student working full time as a warehouse associate. I'm taking coding classes so that I can eventually change careers to one that is more technical or involves computers.</p>
                    <p>I am taking classes at Bellevue College and just started learning HTML and CSS, but soon I'm going to explore JavaScript and GitHub. My main focus is to expand my knowledge in coding and contribute to making projects that are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. I haven't thought about it recently, but I may be willing to work on group projects. You can reach me at paul.sun@bellevuecollege.edu, or click on Email in the top right corner.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>While attending Bellevue College, I'm planning on earning a Certificate of Accomplishment in Web Content Management. However, after looking through potential careers and learning about web development, I might direct most of my attention to front-end web development. Therefore, I'm planning on looking into frameworks and libraries as well as cross-browser and device testing in the future.</p>
                    <p>Before Bellevue College, I graduated from Whittier College with a Bachelor's Degree majoring in kinesiology and minoring in physics. However, I lost interest in careers associated with those fields of study. That's how I ended up as a warehouse associate.</p>

                    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>I have worked as a full-time warehouse associate at Amazon Fresh for almost 8 years at the time of writing this. I actually used what I learned in kinesiology and physics to modify my movements and develop a personal routine to enhance my performance to the best of my physical ability and accomplish team goals. My main responsibility was to pick and pack customer orders efficiently with decent pack quality. Eventually, I learned more about the computer system used to manage orders and communicated with managers, coworkers, and drivers to make sure that customer orders contained all desired items with no damages and were shipped out on time.</p>
